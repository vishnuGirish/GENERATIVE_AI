Loading and Preprocessing Data:
=================================

The code begins by loading and preprocessing the text data from the file "your_text_data.txt." This text data will be used to train the text generator.



Character Mapping:
================

It creates character-to-index (char_to_idx) and index-to-character (idx_to_char) dictionaries to map characters to integers and vice versa. This mapping is essential for converting text data into a format that the model can work with.



Creating Training Data and Labels:
==================================

The text is divided into overlapping sequences of a fixed length (maxlen). For each sequence, the next character in the text is considered the target label. These sequences and their corresponding target labels are used for training the model.



Vectorizing the Data:
=====================

The training data (x) and target labels (y) are converted into a suitable format for training. This involves one-hot encoding of characters. The x array represents input sequences, and the y array represents the corresponding target characters.



Defining the Model:
===================

The model architecture is defined using the Keras Sequential API. It consists of two LSTM layers: a 256-unit LSTM layer with return_sequences=True (to pass sequences to the next LSTM layer) and a 128-unit LSTM layer. These layers are followed by a Dense layer with a softmax activation function to predict the next character.


Compiling the Model:
=====================

The model is compiled with the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. This configuration is suitable for character-level text generation tasks.



Training the Model:
===================

The model is trained on the vectorized training data (x and y) using a batch size of 128 and 100 training epochs. Training aims to minimize the cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual characters.



Generating Text:
================

The code prepares to generate text by specifying a seed text (seed_text) and the number of characters to generate (num_chars_to_generate).


Text Generation Loop:
=======================

Inside a loop, the code generates one character at a time. For each character to be generated:
It prepares an input sequence (x_pred) based on the current seed_text.
It adjusts the character prediction using a temperature parameter to control randomness.
It samples the next character based on the adjusted probability distribution.
The generated character is appended to the generated_text, and the seed_text is updated by removing the first character and adding the newly generated character.


Printing the Generated Text:
============================

Finally, the code prints the generated text, which is the result of character-by-character generation based on the seed text and the trained model
